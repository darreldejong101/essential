        <h2>New Record Set on Snake!</h2>
        <h4>- A new record on our game Slither Snake has been set, Slawek382 set the record of 252 apples collected on August 28 2019 Slawek283 has played the game for a while and has come up with a strategy on how to get the highest score possible, by covering the edges at the start he gives the apples only the center of the grid to spawn and as he covers many layers of the edge the apples almost always spawn infront of his character making him wasted no time on collecting the apples</h4>
