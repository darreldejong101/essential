                <h4>Aim Clicker is a single player game, where you have to eliminate as many targets as possible. This is done in a 60 second time frame. Each time you complete a round the speed of the reappearing targets increase, thus making the game slowly harder. The game is going through some testing as new levels are being made and a multiplayer option will soon be added. Essential Gaming believes the game can increase brain muscle memory and can help competitive gamer's aim in a first person shooter.</h4></td>
